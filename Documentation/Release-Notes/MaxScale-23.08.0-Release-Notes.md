## Dropped Features

## Deprecated Features

   * The configuration parameters `query_classifier` and `query_classifier_args`
     have been deprecated and are ignored.

## New Features

### [MXS-4232](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-4232) Remember old service password

When the service password is changed, MaxScale will remember and use the previous
password if the new does not work. This makes it easier to manage the changing of
the password, as the password in the backend and in MaxScale need not be changed
simultaneously. More information about this functionality can be found
[here]([here](../Getting-Started/Configuration-Guide.md#include-1).

### [MXS-4377](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-4377) Common options

It is now possible to specify options in an _include_-section, to be included
by other sections. This is useful, for instance, if there are multiple monitors
that otherwise are identically configured, but for their list of servers. More
information about this functionality can be found
[here](../Getting-Started/Configuration-Guide.md#include-1).
